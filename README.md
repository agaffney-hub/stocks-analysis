# Stocks Analysis Project
In this project, Steven is discussing stock prices with his family and wanted to research the average return value of each stock over the course of a year.

## Results
The analysis is that there are very few sets of stock that were having a negative return rate in 2018, so they all were feasible options to choose from.
The below set of code was hard for me to get past, in the sense that it was my main line of code holding me back from getting the entire program to run. More specifically "Increase the tickerIndex" was my problem from getting it to increase the cells value instead of using "tickers(tickerIndex)" as previously used.

Formatting was something new to me, because although I have done it before, this conditional formatting was something I had not encountered before. It was a fairly simple setup, but something I enjoyed to give it more vibrancy than the numbers and easily visualize the pros and cons of each row.

### Summary
The advantages of refactoring code and going back in to analyze code is something that can help with learning, attention to detail and overall condesing of code or re-iterated code that could be otherwise simplified. One main challenge I had was coding back through and backing myself into a corner and not quite being able to see my way out of my problem, however once a few other sets of eyes came and helped, it made this assignment a bit easier, even though still overall challenging, given I was able to easily code through, but not see where my mistakes were.
